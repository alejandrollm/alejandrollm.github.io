Initial symptoms of boxwood blight include circular, tan leaf spots with a dark purple or brown border. Leaf spots may or may not have yellow to reddish halos surrounding the spot. Black stem lesions or blackening of the stems is often seen. This can be confused with black lesions due to Colletotrichum stem canker, a relatively new disease also affecting boxwood stems. Boxwood blight infected leaves become tan and readily drop from the plant leaving bare stems. Rapid defoliation is a characteristic symptom of boxwood blight that separates it from other boxwood diseases. Sections or whole plants turn tan and eventually die. The disease can resemble Volutella blight, except that with Volutella blight, as well as with symptoms of root stress or Phytophthora root disease, the leaves often remain attached to the stems. Box blight can move quickly through infected plants, gardens, and nurseries under favorable environmental conditions [8]
