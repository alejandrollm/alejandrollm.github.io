	<h2></h2>

<p>Some measures are the followings:</p>

                <ol>
				<li>It is very important to start with pathogen-free material, by purchasing from reputable suppliers, 
			         nurseries, or garden centers. Plants and cuttings should be carefully inspected for symptoms.</li>
				<li>Newly purchased plants or rooted cuttings should be isolated from existing boxwood plantings 
				or production areas in in nurseries for at least one month, but preferably, for several months.</li>
				<li>Adequate spacing between plants can help to maximize air circulation and minimize conditions favorable 
					for disease development.</li>
				<li>Since water is important for the spread and development of boxwood blight, it is beneficial to avoid overhead watering.
				It also helps to avoid working with plants when they are wet, since this pathogen can be spread during these types of activities.</li>
	                        <li>Sanitation, accomplished by raking and removing leaf debris, is critical for eliminating and reducing inoculum, since the fungus can survive in plant debris for 
				up to five years. In commercial situations with field plantings, burning the plant debris with a propane torch might be an option.</li>
				<li>Scout and inspect all boxwood plants daily or weekly. As soon as boxwood blight symptoms are detected, immediately pull and remove whole plants and place them in a 
				plastic bag to avoid carrying the infected material through the nursery or landscape. Infected plant material should NOT be composted.</li>
				<li>If you observe suspicious symptoms on boxwoods, it is important to have the disease accurately identified by a specialist. An image gallery of 
				boxwood blight can be found at: http://www.ct.gov/caes/pdio.</li>
	                        <li>Planting less susceptible species of boxwood or alternatives to boxwood can reduce the potential for disease. Examples of alternative plants 
				include some dwarf cultivars of Ilex crenata, Pieris japonica, Rhododendron spp., and Taxus baccata.</li>
				<li>The final strategy for managing boxwood blight involves selection, timing,
					and application of fungicide sprays (11).</li>
			</ol>

	<h2>Fungicides</h2>
	<p>Fungicides are only effective when applied preventively. Fungicide efficacy trials have shown that fungicides containing 
		chlorothalonil (Daconil, Spectro, Concert II) and fludioxonil (Medallion, Palladium) provided the best control when applied preventively. To a lesser extent, fungicides containing azoxystrobin (Heritage), metaconazole (Tourney), pyraclostrobin (Pageant), tebuconazole (Torque), thiophanate methyl (Cleary’s 3336, OHP 6672), trifloxystrobin (Compass), provided fair to good preventative control. Most are not labeled for use on either boxwood, Calonectria (or Cylindrocladium) or both; however, this is changing, 
		so check labels. Remember, spraying plants after the disease is present will NOT control this disease [8].</p>
	<p>The combination of systemic and protectant 
		fungicides in a single application seemed 
		to be an effective disease management strategy (7)</p>

   <hr />
	<h2>Resistant cultivars</h2>
	<p>American or common boxwood (B. sempervirens) cultivars are also very susceptible. Cultivars of Littleleaf (Japanese) and Korean 
		boxwood (B. microphylla and B. sinica, respectively) appear less susceptible because they don’t show severe symptoms and leaf drop,
		but they are still susceptible. None of the commercial boxwood cultivars are immune to this disease. In fact, lesser susceptible (e.g. tolerant) cultivars may act as a ‘Trojan Horse’ introducing the disease into landscapes containing more susceptible cultivars. The value of lesser susceptible cultivars is in the establishment of new boxwood hedges. If planting a new area, use a more tolerant cultivar to lessen your disease pressure in subsequent years. The disease also affects other plants
		within the Buxaceae family, including Pachysandra terminalis (ground spurge) and Sarcococca sp. (sweet box) [8]. </p>
